# Moving from ERC-20 Allowances to Permit2 in the Swap Aggregator

## Background: The Allowance Model

Traditionally, decentralized applications (DEXs, aggregators, vaults, etc.) have relied on the **ERC-20 allowance model**.
This works as follows:

1. A user calls `approve(spender, amount)` on the token contract.
2. The spender (router, contract, etc.) can then transfer up to that amount on the user’s behalf using `transferFrom`.
3. If more access is needed, the user must send another `approve` transaction.

While simple, this model has **drawbacks**:

* **Two transactions required:** The user must first approve, then execute the swap.
* **Infinite approvals are common:** To avoid repetitive approvals, users often grant unlimited approvals, which is a **security risk** if the spender contract is ever compromised.
* **No batching:** Approvals are token-by-token and spender-by-spender, leading to friction in multi-token swaps.
* **Inconsistent support:** Tokens that don’t implement EIP-2612 (`permit()`) require the traditional two-step flow.

## What Permit2 Changes

**Permit2** is a chain-agnostic standard introduced by Uniswap that consolidates token approvals and transfers under one flexible contract. It combines signature-based approvals and batched allowance management into a single system.

Key differences from allowances:

* **One contract, universal access:** Instead of granting allowances directly to every router or aggregator contract, users only need to approve Permit2 once per token. All further approvals or transfers can be delegated via Permit2.
* **Signature approvals (no pre-approve):** Users can sign a typed message (EIP-712) that authorizes a transfer. The swap contract can then present this signature to Permit2, eliminating the need for a prior on-chain `approve` transaction.
* **Batch support:** Approve multiple tokens or multiple spenders in one signature.
* **Non-replayable + time-bounded:** Permits include expiration and nonce fields, reducing the risk of replay attacks.
* **Safer defaults:** Instead of infinite approvals, users can grant granular, temporary rights.

## Why Permit2 is Faster in a Swap Aggregator

For a swap aggregator, every millisecond counts. Here’s why Permit2 is faster:

* **Single transaction flow:** Users can swap in one transaction (signature + swap call) instead of two.
* **Lower gas usage over time:** Once tokens are approved to Permit2, there’s no repeated `approve()` gas cost across routers.
* **Batch execution:** Multi-hop or multi-token swaps can collect all needed permissions in a single signature instead of multiple allowance transactions.
* **Reduced transaction failures:** With allowances, users often forget to approve or approve insufficient amounts, leading to reverts. Permit2 signatures encode the exact spend upfront.

## Why Permit2 is Safer

* **No need for infinite allowances:** Each permit can be for an exact amount, with an expiry.
* **Centralized approval tracking:** Users only need to manage approvals with one contract (Permit2), not every individual router or dApp.
* **Replay protection:** Built-in nonces and expiration ensure signatures cannot be reused maliciously.
* **Audited, standardized implementation:** Unlike random token contracts with inconsistent `permit()` support, Permit2 provides a unified, trusted interface.

## Integrating Permit2 in the Aggregator

In your aggregator (now updated):

1. **User flow:**

   * User signs a Permit2 approval for the input token.
   * Aggregator submits the signature alongside the swap call.
   * Permit2 validates and transfers tokens to the aggregator in a single step.

2. **Developer benefits:**

   * Cleaner code: one adapter for all tokens.
   * Reduced UX friction: no need for “approve” modals before swapping.
   * Compatibility across chains: Permit2 works the same way everywhere.

## Bottom Line

By moving from traditional allowances to **Permit2**, the swap aggregator becomes:

* **Faster:** fewer transactions, smoother UX.
* **Cheaper:** reduced gas costs from repeated approvals.
* **Safer:** no more risky infinite approvals, with built-in expiry and replay protection.
* **Smarter:** supports batch operations and cross-chain consistency.

Permit2 is the next step forward for token approvals — and for your swap aggregator, it transforms the experience from clunky two-step flows into a seamless, secure one-transaction trade.

# Allowances vs. Permit2

| Feature / Aspect           | Legacy ERC-20 Allowances                                                      | Permit2 (Unified Approvals)                                        |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Setup Flow**             | Requires `approve()` *then* `swap()` (two txs).                               | Single transaction: signature + swap execution.                    |
| **UX Friction**            | User must pre-approve for each token + spender.                               | One-time approval to Permit2, then signatures.                     |
| **Batch Support**          | Not supported. One approval per token/spender.                                | Supported: multiple tokens/spenders in one signature.              |
| **Gas Efficiency**         | Extra gas every time a new approval is needed.                                | Lower over time: no repeated `approve()` costs.                    |
| **Security**               | Users often grant *infinite approvals* (high risk if spender is compromised). | Exact spend amounts, with expiries + nonces to prevent misuse.     |
| **Replay Protection**      | None — allowance remains until reset.                                         | Built-in nonces + expiration prevent replay.                       |
| **Revocation**             | Must send another `approve(0)` per spender/token.                             | Centralized revocation via Permit2.                                |
| **Compatibility**          | Works on all ERC-20s, but inconsistent with permit support (EIP-2612).        | Works universally across all ERC-20s, chain-agnostic.              |
| **Aggregator Integration** | Each router/contract needs explicit approval.                                 | Only Permit2 needs approval — simplifies multi-router aggregation. |
| **Multi-Hop Swaps**        | May fail if allowances not set for each step.                                 | Single Permit2 approval covers all paths.                          |

✅ **Summary**:

* **Allowances** are simple but clunky: multiple txs, risky infinite approvals, and no batching.
* **Permit2** is **faster, safer, and aggregator-friendly**: one approval per token, reusable everywhere, with granular control.
